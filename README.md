# Classification-of-Brain-Tumors-in-Images-Using-GLCM-Feature-Extraction

Brain tumor is a disease caused by the growth of abnormal tissue in the brain. Brain tumors are also a deadly disease and can attack anyone. To detect brain tumors, an examination can be carried out using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) by processing the image data produced by the tool. In this project, the authors also try to detect the existing images in the dataset on kaggle to then detect whether there is a tumor or something anomalous in the image obtained. In this project, research will be carried out using the Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method as feature extraction on images followed by the Random Forest classification model.
